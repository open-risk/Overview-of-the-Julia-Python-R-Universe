## Overview-of-the-Julia-Python-R-Universe
Contribute to the side by side overview of the three leading open source data science ecosystems of today


The Overview of the Julia-Python-R Universe [article](https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Overview_of_the_Julia-Python-R_Universe) is a side by side comparison of a wide range of aspects of Python, Julia and R language ecosystems (sometimes affectionately named "jupyter"). The comparison of the three ecosystems aims at high level:

* To be useful for people that are somewhat familiar with programming and want to inspect options and use of the most appropriate tool
* To promote interoperability, cross-validation and overall best-practices across these ecosystems
* To be factual as much as possible without drifting to judgement / opinions

The comparison *does not* aim:

* To be a detailed / comprehensive catalog of all available libraries (which count to many thousands!)
* To cover use cases very removed from "data science" (this applies in particular to python that as a general purpose language finds its way in various other computer science domains)
* To be exhaustive (e.g to identify all the possible computer systems one can run a Python interpreter on, or count all the possible ways one can perform linear regression in R)

## How to use this repo
This repo is to facilitate (and properly document contributions and discussions) of the three-way overview of the Julia-Python-R universe, sometimes affectionatly known as the "Jupyter" trio.
